# skill-search

Before tackling this task, call the `search_skills` MCP tool with a short query
describing the user's goal. It returns ranked skills by semantic relevance.

Then:
1. Read the returned names + descriptions.
2. Invoke the genuinely relevant ones by name (e.g. /frontend-design).
3. Ignore low-score results — do not load skills that aren't relevant.
4. If a result looks promising but the description is thin, call `get_skill`
   on it before deciding.

Prefer 2-4 high-relevance skills over loading many. Precision keeps context lean.
